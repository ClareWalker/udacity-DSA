Explanation:

The use of recursion in this problem allows us to traverse the hierarchical structure of the groups and subgroups. We start by checking if the user is present in the current group's user list. If not, we recursively call the is_user_in_group function on each subgroup to continue searching until the user is found or all subgroups have been checked.

Time Complexity: 

The time complexity of the is_user_in_group function is worst case O(n * m), where n is the total number of groups in the hierarchy and m is the average number of users in each group. This includes:
 - time required for traversing each group, which worst case O(n) if the user is in the last group or not present.
 - time required for checking if the user is present in the group's user list, which is O(m), the average time complexity of the "in" operator on lists in Python.


Space Complexity: 

 - The space complexity of the is_user_in_group function is determined by the depth of recursion. 
 - Each recursive call adds a new frame to the call stack. 
 - In the worst case, where the group hierarchy is deep, the space complexity will be O(d), where d is the depth of the hierarchy. 
 - Additionally, the space complexity is also influenced by the size of the user lists in the groups.
