Explanation: 

By using sets to implement the union and intersection functions, we can leverage the inherent properties of sets, such as uniqueness and efficient membership testing. 
Sets automatically eliminate duplicate elements, ensuring that the resulting union and intersection sets contain only unique elements. Additionally, set operations like `add` and `intersection` are optimized for efficient element lookup, making the implementation straightforward and effective.

Time Complexity:

The time complexity of the union and intersection functions depends on the number of elements in the input linked lists. The key set operations used are `add` for building the union set and `intersection` for constructing the intersection set.

- For `add` operation: The time complexity of `set.add(value)` is O(1) because sets are implemented as hash tables, providing constant time complexity for adding elements to the set.
- For `intersection` operation: The time complexity of `set.intersection(other_set)` is O(min(n, m)), where n and m are the sizes of the two sets being intersected. Python's set intersection operation checks each element of the smaller set against the larger set, resulting in a time complexity proportional to the size of the smaller set.

Therefore, the overall time complexity of the union and intersection functions is determined by the sum of the individual operations performed on the sets, resulting in O(n + m) time complexity, where n and m are the sizes of the input linked lists.

Space Complexity:

The space complexity of the union and intersection functions depends on the size of the resulting union and intersection sets, respectively. 
As sets only contain unique elements, the space complexity is proportional to the number of distinct elements in the input linked lists. If there are n elements in the first linked list and m elements in the second linked list, the space complexity would be O(min(n, m)), considering the smaller size of the resulting sets.

In summary, by utilizing sets for the union and intersection functions, we benefit from their inherent properties such as uniqueness and efficient membership testing. The time complexity is O(n + m) due to the set operations used, with `add` having O(1) time complexity and `intersection` having O(min(n, m)) time complexity. The space complexity is O(min(n, m)), reflecting the size of the resulting sets.
