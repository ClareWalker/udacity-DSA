Explanation:

 - Trie: A Trie, also known as a Prefix Tree, is a tree-like data structure used for efficient retrieval of words or strings. It is particularly useful for searching for words with a common prefix or implementing autocomplete features. In this implementation, the Trie is built using a collection of interconnected TrieNode objects.
 - TrieNode: Each TrieNode represents a single character in a word. It contains a dictionary (children) to store the child nodes corresponding to the next characters in the word. The keys of the dictionary are characters, and the values are the corresponding child TrieNode objects. The is_word attribute indicates whether the current node represents the end of a complete word. Dictionaries are preferred to e.g. lists as they offer insertion and look-up in constant time.

Time Complexity:

 - Insertion: The insert method in the TrieNode class has a time complexity of O(1) since it involves adding a child node to the children dictionary. When inserting a word into the Trie using the insert method of the Trie class, it takes O(K) time, where K is the length of the word.
 - Finding Suffixes: The suffixes method in the TrieNode class is a recursive function. The time complexity of this method depends on the number of nodes in the Trie and the length of the longest word. In the worst case, when there are no shared prefixes among the words, the method needs to traverse all nodes in the Trie once, resulting in a time complexity of O(N), where N is the total number of characters in the Trie.

Space Complexity:

 - Creating & storing Trie: The space complexity of the Trie data structure depends on the number of nodes required to store the words. In the worst case, where there are no shared prefixes among the words, the number of nodes will be equal to the number of characters in all the words combined. Therefore, the space complexity of the Trie is O(N), where N is the total number of characters.
 - Finding suffixes (using recursion): The space complexity of the suffixes method is also determined by the number of nodes visited during the recursive calls. In the worst case, it will visit all the nodes in the Trie, resulting in a space complexity of O(N), where N is total number of nodes.
