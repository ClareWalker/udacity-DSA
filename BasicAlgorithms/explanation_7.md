Explanation:

As required, we utilize the Trie data structure to implement the HTTPRouter. The Trie is an efficient choice for this purpose because it allows us to store and retrieve paths efficiently. Each node in the Trie represents a part of the path, and the paths are constructed by traversing the Trie. By using a Trie, we can efficiently handle routing requests by matching the given path with the stored paths in the Trie. The Trie provides a fast lookup time and helps us organize the paths in a hierarchical manner.
Children for each node are stored as a dictionary, which offer insertion and look-up in constant time.

Time Complexity:

 - Insertion: The time complexity for inserting a path into the Trie is O(m), where m is the length of the path. During the insertion process, we traverse the Trie by iterating over the parts of the path. Each part of the path is used as a key to access the child nodes of the current node. By utilizing dictionaries in Python, the access time to retrieve child nodes is significantly reduced compared to other data structures. The 'in' operator, when used with dictionaries, has an average time complexity of O(1). This allows us to efficiently check if a specific part already exists in the current node's children, and if not, insert it with constant time complexity.
 - Lookup: The time complexity for looking up a path in the Trie is also O(m), where m is the length of the path. Similar to the insertion process, we traverse the Trie by iterating over the parts of the path. At each node, we use the 'in' operator to check if the current part exists in the node's children. Again, the 'in' operator with dictionaries provides a fast lookup time complexity of O(1) on average. This allows us to quickly navigate through the Trie and find the corresponding handler for the given path. 

In summary, the use of dictionaries and the 'in' operator significantly improves the efficiency of both insertion and lookup operations in the Trie. It provides constant-time access to child nodes, resulting in a more efficient implementation with a time complexity of O(m) for both operations.

Space Complexity:

The space complexity for storing paths in the Trie depends on the number of unique parts present in all the paths. If there are n unique parts in the paths, the space complexity would be O(n). Each node in the Trie represents a part of the path, and the Trie structure itself consumes additional space.
