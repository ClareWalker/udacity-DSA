Explanation:

The above solution uses two variables, minimum and maximum, to keep track of the current minimum and maximum values as we iterate through the array.
 - We initialize both variables with the first element of the array
 - Then, we iterate through the remaining elements and update the minimum and maximum values if we find a smaller or larger number, respectively. 

This algorithm is a variation of the "Divide and Conquer" algorithm. In the standard Divide and Conquer approach, a problem is divided into smaller subproblems, solved independently, and then combined to obtain the final result. 
However, in this particular case, instead of dividing the array into subproblems, we divide it into pairs of elements and compare them to determine the minimum and maximum.
 
Time complexity:

The algorithm traverses the array once, comparing each element with the current minimum and maximum values. Therefore, it has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

Space complexity:

The function only requires a few variables (minimum, maximum, and num) to keep track of the minimum and maximum values and the current element during the traversal. 
These variables occupy a constant amount of space regardless of the size of the input array. Therefore, the space complexity is constant or O(1).
