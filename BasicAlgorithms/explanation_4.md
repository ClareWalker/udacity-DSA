Explanation:

The solution uses Three-Way Partitioning a.k.a. Three-Way Quicksort algorithm to sort the input list of 0s, 1s, and 2s. It is a variation of the Quicksort algorithm and is used to partition an array into three parts based on a pivot element. 
It's an efficient technique when dealing with problems that require dividing elements into multiple partitions based on some criteria. It achieves the sort with only a single traversal of the list by swapping elements as necessary, in this way the algorithm effectively partitions the list into three sections: 0s on the left, 1s in the middle, and 2s on the right, resulting in a sorted list.

Time complexity:

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) because we traverse the input list only once. 

Space complexity:

The space complexity is O(1) as we use only a constant amount of additional space for the three pointers.
