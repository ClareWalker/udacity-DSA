Explanation:

The rotated_array_search function implements a modified version of binary search to find the target value in a rotated sorted array. 
The algorithm maintains two pointers, start and end, which represent the range of indices to search within. It repeatedly calculates the middle index mid and checks if the middle element is equal to the target value. If it is, the function returns the index of the middle element.
If the middle element is not the target value, the function checks if the left half or the right half of the array is sorted. It then determines whether the target value lies within the sorted half or the rotated half. Based on this information, it adjusts the pointers start and end to continue the search in the appropriate half of the array.
The algorithm continues this process until the target value is found or the search space is exhausted. 

Time complexity:

The time complexity of the rotated_array_search function is O(log n), where n is the size of the input list. 
The algorithm uses a modified binary search approach to find the target value. In each iteration, the search space is halved, reducing the number of elements to search. 
This logarithmic behavior makes the algorithm efficient even for large input sizes.

Space complexity Analysis:

The space complexity of the rotated_array_search function is O(1). The algorithm uses a constant amount of additional space to store the pointers start, end, and mid, as well as the target value. It does not require any extra data structures or recursion, resulting in a constant space complexity.
